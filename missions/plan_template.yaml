# /!\ This is a template file, it has not been tested and is not meant to be used as is,
# it is meant to be used as a starting point to create a mission plan for the AUV.

# A plan is a directed graph where each node is a mission and each edge is a condition to go to the next mission
# The plan is defined in a YAML file and is loaded by the mission planner to create the mission graph
# The mission planner uses the graph to determine the next mission to execute based on the current state of the AUV.

# An example of how to run this template is:
# python3 -m auv.mission.mission_planner -p missions/plan_template.yaml

gate:
  mission_name: gate_mission
  next_nodes:
    - buoy # no condition means it will always go to the next mission

buoy:
  mission_name: buoy_mission
  timeout: 100 # mission will be timed out after 100 seconds
  next_nodes:
    # nodes can have multiple outgoing edges where each edge can have a condition
    # - next_mission: condition to go to next mission
    - bins: self.buoy.return_code == 0 # 0 means the buoy mission succeeded
    - dhd_approach: self.buoy.return_code == 1 # 1 means the buoy mission failed
    - surfacing: self.buoy.return_code == 2 # 2 means the buoy mission timed out

bins:
  mission_name: bin_mission
  next_nodes:
    - torpedoes

torpedoes:
  mission_name: torpedo_mission
