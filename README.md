# robosub_2023
Team Inspiration's repository for the RoboSub 2023 competition
We are using ROS, python, C++

*Please use this repository only for source files*; do not upload binary files like images/videos/ROSBags.

**TO DO:**

write the .gitignore file

create the basic empty template programs 
- one for a hypothetical sensor stub, one mapper, a mission planner, and one for MAVROS (this will be made into a path follower)

verify integration using the template programs
