Arbitrary size data transfers for Water Linked Underwater Modems

WlUDPSocket is the interface for sending/receiving arbitrary length data (datagram) with
a Water Linked Underwater Modem.

This style of transfer is suitable for short messages and has low overhead at 3 bytes for each
datagram (1 start byte, 1 checksum and 1 end byte).
The datagram will be corrupted by any single modem packet dropped (while still taking the full time to transmit),
which means it is only suitable for short datagrams.
The Modem-M64 has a payload size of 8 bytes and hence messages, so the chance of success with given
chance of any packet lost is given by:

chance of success = (100 - chance of packet loss) / 100 ^ (number of packets sent) * 100

For example, with a 5% chance of packet loss and datagram of 77 bytes (with the 3 overhead bytes this gives 10 packets):

chance of success = (1.0-0.05)**10 * 100 = 59.8%

Internally it uses a thread to frame, packetizes and sends the datagrams given via the "send" function.
When a full datagram is received by the modem it is put on a queue and can be retrieved with the "receive" function.
